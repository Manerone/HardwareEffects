# Hardware Effects

This repo contains a bunch of code demonstrating hardware effects on performance, plus my own deviations it.

Let's evaluate how atomic operations behave in CPP. This project is inspired by the talk given by Fedor Pikus on CppCon 2017 ([link](https://youtu.be/ZQFzMfHIxng?si=n2j7P782lwJ9jimn)).
